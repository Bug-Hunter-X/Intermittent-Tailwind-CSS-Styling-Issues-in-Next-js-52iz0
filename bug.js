I'm using Tailwind CSS in a Next.js project and am encountering a strange issue where some of my styles aren't being applied consistently.  For example, I have a button with the class `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700`, but sometimes the hover effect doesn't work, and other times it works perfectly fine. There are no Javascript errors in the console, and the classes seem to be applied correctly according to the browser's developer tools. This problem is intermittent and hard to reproduce reliably.
