The solution to this type of problem often involves carefully checking for conflicts and ensuring proper CSS loading.  One approach is to investigate any JavaScript that might modify the DOM and potentially conflict with the CSS application. It is also recommended to carefully check for any other CSS being included that might unintentionally override Tailwind's styles. Ensure that your Next.js application is correctly hydrating and there are no conflicts between server-side and client-side rendering.  For more persistent issues, thoroughly clearing browser caches and restarting the development server may help. In some instances, rebuilding the entire project may be necessary.
